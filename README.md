# Internship Task 4 â€“ SQL for Data Analysis (PostgreSQL)

## ðŸ“„ Overview
This project contains SQL queries executed on the **Northwind** PostgreSQL sample database as part of my Data Analyst internship **Task 4**.  
The queries demonstrate core SQL concepts including:
- Filtering data (`WHERE`, `HAVING`)
- Joining multiple tables (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
- Subqueries
- Creating Views
- Query optimization with Indexes
- Handling NULL values

---

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
The **Northwind** sample database simulates a small e-commerce business with:
- Customers
- Orders
- Products
- Order Details
- Categories
- Suppliers

The database was loaded into PostgreSQL using:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE northwind;
```
Then the schema and data were imported using `northwind.sql` and `northwind-data.sql`.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **PostgreSQL** (v15+)
- **pgAdmin 4** for running queries and viewing results
- **Northwind sample database** (PostgreSQL version)

---

## â–¶ Steps to Run
1. Create and load the `northwind` database in PostgreSQL.
2. Open **pgAdmin 4** and connect to the `northwind` database.
3. Open `task4.sql` in the **Query Tool**.
4. Run each query **one by one** and observe the output.
5. Take screenshots showing:
   - Query text (top panel)
   - Query results (bottom panel)
6. Save all screenshots.

## ðŸ“‹ Queries in `task4.sql`
1. **WHERE vs HAVING** â€“ Filtering before and after aggregation.
2. **INNER JOIN** â€“ Matching customers with their orders.
3. **LEFT JOIN** â€“ Showing all customers, even if they have no orders.
4. **RIGHT JOIN** â€“ Showing all orders, even if no matching customer is found.
5. **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)** â€“ Using SUM and COUNT with DISTINCT.
6. **Subquery** â€“ Products priced above the average price.
7. **Create Index** â€“ Optimizing lookups on `customer_id` in `orders`.
8. **Create View** â€“ High value customers who spent more than 10,000.
9. **Handling NULL Values** â€“ Using `COALESCE` to replace NULLs with descriptive text.
